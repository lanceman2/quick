// CAUTION: We bit diddle for widget types using just a 32 bit int.
//
// TODO: This limits the number of types of widgets we can have in
// libpanels.so.  The number we can have depends on the number of layers
// of widget inheritance (in this C sense of inheritance).  We assign N
// bit layer at each level of widget inheritance, so if a widget
// inherits another widget it gets a type number that is a combination of
// two type numbers.  So far it looks like there are plenty of widget type
// numbers available with just one 32 bit number.
//
// Note: In panels, widget layout is a separate thing from widget type,
// though the two are not necessarily independent (orthogonal attributes).
//
// We keep a one widget type at each level.  The higher level type
// inherits a lower level type.  So widgets can be more than one type of
// widget at a time; though most widgets are just one type at level 1.

    // it just once when the code is written.  Any time a base widget adds
    // or removes an action all the widget indexes need to adjust their
    // fixed values (a compile time change).  It appears that the setup of

// It looks like most GUI (graphical user interface) based programs
// (Wayland compositor included), as we shrink a window cull out the
// parts of the window to the right and bottom, keeping the left and top
// most part of the window.  This is just convention, and "panels" follows
// this convention.  Hence, we cull out widgets to the right and bottom as
// windows shrink.  Widgets that cannot get there requested size due to
// this window shrink culling will not be drawn, and the background
// drawing of the window will be shown to the GUI user where widgets are
// culled out and there is not large enough room in the lower right corner
// of the window.

// It turns out that the Wayland client has per process global data that
// we are forced, by the wayland design, to have in this code.  This is
// not a limitation that we prefer but we did not want to make our own
// windowing standard.  We had to start somewhere.
//
// I just want to make a thing that lets us quickly color pixels in a
// window (and sub-windows) without writing ten thousand lines of compiled
// source code.  Just a stupid little wrapper library.  "panels" is an
// order of magnitude smaller than GTK and Qt (leaky bloat monsters).

// Consolidate what would be many globals into one structure so as make
// finding and understanding all these singleton objects easier.  We
// appear to be trying to make what was in libX11 was called a "display"
// object; but in libX11 the display was not necessarily a singleton
// object: you could make as many X11 client display connections in a
// given process as you wanted (or so it appeared given the interface).
// This Wayland limitation seems short sighted to me.  On the brighter
// side, Wayland is much less complex than X11, and could in many cases
// have better performance (depends on a lot of shit, I suppose).
//
// When comparing the X11 client and the Wayland client: X11 is a huge
// beast of complexity, Wayland is simple with more of its guts hanging
// out.  Wayland broke up all the opaque X11 like display object into many
// opaque Wayland objects.  Wayland seems to be providing more
// compartmentalization (more parts) then X11.  Wayland in effect exposes
// more of what would be internal (X11) components.  The Wayland client
// way have more control, but at a cost of having to write more code in
// many cases.
//
// I grant you, X11 maybe did not expose enough object layers; which maybe
// in time caused to blow up with extensions and force server internal
// bloat.  I love the simple idea of writing to shared memory pixels that
// exists in Wayland client; the X11 client API approach of providing a
// drawing primitives just smells of inefficiency and inflexibility.
// For example, did all drawing operations incur a system call or two
// (for all I know they did not all the time).

// Constrained by libwayland-client, we can only have one Pn Display
// object in a process.  Not our fucking choose.  We're lucky that it's
// not leaky (memory, files, and shit) like most libraries.  It appears
// that for every Wayland client object that you can create there is a
// destroy function, and that's a real good thing.  Most large popular
// libraries do not do this.
