// something like a virtual input device from the panels API user's code
// which may have "throttling" code in it; or a
//   2. signal received from the wayland compositor (like in the static
// case below).
//
// When does the panels API user code plot points and/or lines?
//
// We need to keep the fast data input from being drawn when it never
// shows to the user because it is drawn faster than the wayland
// compositor refresh rate.
//
// Overrun we define as when the fast data input is drawn and it never

// compositor refresh rate.  If the user just misses seeing 2 frames out
// of 10 drawn, that may be okay; but missing 999 frames out of 1000
// frames may be wasting a lot of operating system resources for
// nothing.
//
// For device input under-run (device input is relatively slow), input
// needs to queue a draw when the input comes.  Both the device input and
// the wayland compositor (configure, mouse pointer motions events, and
// keyboard events) must drive the plot drawing.

// A 2D plotter has a lot of parameters.  This "graph" thingy is just the
// parameters that we choose to draw the background line grid of a 2D
// graph (plotter).  It has a "zoom" object in it that is parametrization
// of the 2D (linear) transformation for the window (widget/pixels) view.
// This is the built-in stuff.  Of course a user could draw arbitrarily
// pixels on top of this.  And so, yes, this is not natively 2D vector
// graphics, but one could over-lay a reduction of 2D vector graphics on
// top of this.  I don't think that computers are fast enough to make
// real-time (operator-in-the-loop) 2D vector graphics (at 60 Hz or
// faster), we must use pixels as the basis, though the grid uses Cairo, a
// floating point calculation of pixels values for the very static (not
// changing fast) background plotter grid lines.
//
// Note: we could speed up the background grid drawing by not using Cairo,
// because the background grid drawing requires just horizontal and
// vertical line drawing with which it is easier to calculate the
// anti-aliasing then Cairo's general anti-aliased line (lines at general
// angles).  But, the grid background drawing is not a performance
// bottleneck, so fuck it.
//
// The foreground points plotted may just directly set the pixel colors as
// a uint32_t (32 bit int), or a slower Cairo based foreground drawing.
// Cairo drawing can be about 10 to 1000 times slower than just changing a
// few individual pixels numbers in the mapped memory.  It's just that we
// are comparing the speed of doing something (memory copying all the
// widget pixels for any one frame, after floating point fucking all of
// them) to the speed of doing next to nothing (like 1 out of a 1000
// pixels being changed).  It depends where the bottleneck is.  If you do
// not need fast pixel changes, Cairo drawing could be fine.  Cairo
// drawing will likely look better than just simple integer pixel bit
// diddling.  It's hard to do anti-aliasing without floating point
// calculations.
//
// We can slowly draw background once (one frame), then quickly draw on
// top of it, 20 million points over many many frames.
//

// too, though it draws a grid of horizontal and vertical lines.
