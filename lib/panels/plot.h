// For time faded beam oscilloscope using just single pixel points per

// This is the use less memory method (not as big as the widget pixel
// buffer, if there are fewer stored points per draw frame):
//
// This uses a linked list of "points" that when in use are drawn at every
// frame; for example every 0.01667 seconds (at 60 Hz) we draw and fade
// all active points from first to last.  For performance this assumes
// that the list is small compared to the number of pixels in the graph
// widget.
//
// Drawing more than the BeamPoint list in a frame will simply overwrite
// the older values of the BeamPoint buffer.
//
// We make (more memory) an array of points that maps one to one to all
// the available pixels in the graph widget. The linked list is embedded
// in the array.  When points in the array are overwritten (by user
// plotting) the color, and prev (and next?) of that point and it's
// neighboring points are patched.  This could keep us from redundant
// pixel coloring, but at a cost of using lots of unused memory given that
// we are coloring only a small portion of all the pixels that the graph
// widget has.  We'd copy the embedded list to the graph widget pixel
// buffer for every draw frame, as this does now.  The old quickscope
// project does this.
//
// We should be able to keep a user (and underlying) interfaces the same
// for both of the two methods (1, 2 above).  So, we could seamlessly
// switch between the two methods, assuming we implement both methods.
